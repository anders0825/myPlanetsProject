            <p>
              Mercury is the smallest planet, only 4,880 km in diameter. It's a
              dense, rocky planet with a massive iron core making up most of its
              interior. It orbits just 58 million km from the Sun. A year is
              only 88 Earth days, but a day (one full rotation) takes 59 Earth
              days. Known since antiquity, it was observed by Babylonian, Greek,
              and Roman astronomers.

              Venus is nearly Earth's twin in size (12,104 km diameter) and is a
              rocky planet with a thick carbon-dioxide atmosphere and sulfuric
              acid clouds. It lies about 108 million km from the Sun. Its orbit
              takes 225 Earth days, while its rotation is extremely slow and
              retrograde, lasting 243 Earth days. Also visible to the naked eye,
              Venus has been observed since ancient times and was first studied
              telescopically by Galileo in 1610.

              Earth's Moon is about 3,474 km across (just over a quarter of
              Earth's size). It's a rocky body made mostly of silicate minerals
              with a small iron core. It orbits Earth at an average distance of
              384,400 km, taking 27.3 days to orbit and rotate (tidally locked,
              so the same side always faces Earth). It wasn't “discovered” —
              humans have always seen it — but the first telescopic studies were
              by Galileo Galilei in 1609.

              Mars is about half Earth's size (6,779 km diameter) and is a rocky
              planet rich in iron oxide (rust), which gives it its red color. It
              orbits at 228 million km from the Sun. A Martian year lasts 687
              Earth days, and a day (a “sol”) is just a bit longer than ours at
              24.6 hours. Known since ancient times, it was documented by early
              civilizations and studied in detail with telescopes from the 1600s
              onward.

              Saturn is famous for its rings and measures 116,460 km across.
              Like Jupiter, it's a gas giant mostly made of hydrogen and helium.
              It orbits at 1.4 billion km from the Sun, with a year lasting
              about 29 Earth years, and it rotates quickly — one day is about
              10.7 hours. Known since ancient times, its rings were first seen
              by Galileo in 1610, though Christiaan Huygens (1655) correctly
              identified them.

              composed of hydrogen, helium, and a high proportion of “ices” like
              water and methane (which gives it its blue color). It orbits about
